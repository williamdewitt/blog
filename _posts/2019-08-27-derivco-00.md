This is my story and experiences of starting my first job as a permanent employee in an industry I am barely familiar with and as such I am taking lessons from Dawid Dylowicz at [More Than Testing](https://morethantesting.com) and his series
[Joining a startup as the first QA](https://morethantesting.com/blog/how-to-prepare-for-a-leadership-role/) and [How To Survive Your First Day At The Office (Infographic)](https://www.chairoffice.co.uk/blog/how-to-survive-your-first-day-at-the-office-infographic/).

As Dawid did, I will be tracking and journaling by beginnings and so far I have decided on:

- First Day (4th of September 2019)
- First Week (8th of September 2019)
- First Month (30th of September 2019) and
- First Three Months (30 of November 2019)
