## Find an accessibility bug

Finding accessibility bugs are easy... the challenge comes in deciding which ones you absolutely have to tackle.

Just to add some colour to this post, here are some bugs found on the MoT home page.  This is by no means an excersise to point fingers but rather to demonstrate how easy it can be to do these test and show that there is no reason not.

As you can see there is more to the tool than just the accessibility tests but that is beyond the scope of this article.

I am planning on doing a piece about time-boxed testing and we'll be looking at some of the other tests there.
