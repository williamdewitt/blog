## Take a photo of something you are doing at work

Currently this is how I feel at work...  I have come to the end of my time at my current work place and new work has come to a grinding halt since the contract with a development company has been canceled.

Now I am just trying to find the odd thing here and there to do along side some user support while I count down the days until I go on leave and then start my new job!

More details on my new work place to follow in an upcoming series of my x days at a new job.

Watch this space!
