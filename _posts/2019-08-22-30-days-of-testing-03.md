## Listen to a testing podcast

So I did some googling for this one and came across a few testing pod casts which I have listed [here](/resources.md/).

I started with [Testing Podcast](https://testingpodcast.com/) and episode "106: Weapons of Math Destruction" where the main topic was ethics in the data science field.  So I have noticed that data science has become quite popular recently and I guess that is mainly because of AI/ML becoming a business driving tool.

One of the points that really stood out for me is a comment that one of the guys said that resinated with me.  He said that he has seen a lot of data science guys give presentations to an audience that has little to no knowledge in the field where they would throw a bunch of number and math equations on a slide to present. What then happens is at the end of the presentation, the presentees would respond with "oh... well... good job, keep on with that".

I find that there is a similar lack of understanding for the larger testing/QA role where it seems that roles beyond testing aren't to sure what to make of all this testing jargon and I find myself and team trying to explain or having to teach our line managers what it really means to ensure the quality of a product from both the business and user point of view.

This is an issue that I will have to explore in a different post but as far as this task goes, consider it done ;)

Short, sweet, done.
