## Buy one testing related book and read it by day 30

Ok so for this one I don't think I am going to by another testing related book but maybe start with the ones that I already own but have not yet completed.  This might also be a good time to list some good "testing related" books, although, I do use that term loosely.

- [ ] Advanced Software Testing - Vol. 3
- [ ] Lessons Learned in Software Testing
- [x] Clean Code
- [x] The Clean Coder
- [ ] Clean Architecture
- [ ] The DevOps Handbook
- [x] The Phoenix Project
- [ ] The Unicorn Project

### Advanced Software Testing - Vol. 3

So I've bought this book a while back because of a few reasons. Of these, the main reason was the intention of sitting the ISTQB Advanced Technical Test Analyst exam.  I still feel that I should do that but we will see what time allows.

Back to the book...

TOC
- Test Basics
- Testing Processes
- Test Management
- Test Techniques
- Tests of Software Characteristics
- Reviews
- Incident Management
- Standards and Test Process Improvement
- Test Techniques (Test Tools)
- People Skills and Team Composition
- Preparing for the Exam

#### Chapter 1
Testing strategies and plans... this is an area that I can greatly improve on.  For now I am just going to list a few on the types of strategies that I can hopefully explore at a later stage.

- requirements-based
- analytical risk-based

Things to keep in mind when defining testing on the different test levels.

- Clearly defined test goals and scope
- Traceability tot the test basis
- Entry and exit criteria
- Test deliverables
- Test techniques that will be applied
- Measurements and metrics
- Test tools
- Compliance with organizational or other standards

Metrics and measurements... another nemesis of mine.

#### Chapter 2
