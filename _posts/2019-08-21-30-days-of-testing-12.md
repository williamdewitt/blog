## Doodle a problem

Not an in order type of 30 Days of Testing exercise...

So item number 12 on the list is to doodle a problem...  I have no idea what is meant by this but Google got my back anyway. One of the results was a Medium article on how to doodle your way out of a problem and that kind of sounds like the same thing.

From a quick scan, this seems to be a great exercise and I am definitely going to make some time to follow along.
