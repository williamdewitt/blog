This is my story and experiences of starting my first job as a permanent employee in an industry I am barely familiar with and as such I am taking lessons from Dawid Dylowicz at [More Than Testing](https://morethantesting.com) and his series
[Joining a startup as the first QA](https://morethantesting.com/blog/how-to-prepare-for-a-leadership-role/) and [How To Survive Your First Day At The Office (Infographic)](https://www.chairoffice.co.uk/blog/how-to-survive-your-first-day-at-the-office-infographic/).
