# Do a crazy test

Taking inspiration from those who were challengers before me.

Thank you Lina Zubyte at [Let Me Try Software Testing](https://letmetrysoftwaretesting.wordpress.com/tag/crazy-test/) and Name Here at [Adventures in QA](https://adventuresinqa.com/2016/07/01/30-days-testing-challenge/) for completing the bonus challenge.  My first reaction was "what the F*$# is a crazy test?"; isn't most testing a bit crazy...
